We are people who have felt the weight of structural inequity &#x26; inequality in the Central Coast, which are rooted in colonial systems of white supremacy, cisheteropatriarchy, ableism, capitalism, and other forms of oppression, for a <em>long</em> time. We are also people who can no longer remain idle while others suffer in front of us.</p>\n<p><strong>We are writing this in the midst of a global uprising for Black lives, the latest upsurge in a struggle over 400 years in the making</strong>. All over the country, in these occupied Native lands now known as the United States, the people are rising up for a brighter future, for Black people and for all people affected by the violence of the carceral* system. And this summer has shown us one crucial fact: <strong>we can win</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>We have seen victories from San Francisco to Oakland to Austin to Minneapolis this year</strong> in defunding police, removing police from schools, getting jails closed, and winning avowals of the intention to invest in affirming, life-giving futures: futures for Black people, Indigenous people, all people of color, and all people directly affected by the violence of the carceral state. <strong>But we know there is so much more to do</strong>. We know this fight is <em>far</em> from over.</p>\n<p><strong>We know that we are still fighting <em>right</em> here on the Central Coast.</strong> We all know that the fight to make sure #BlackLivesMatter here has gone on all summer. And we are all aware of the repression facing these young Black &#x26; brown folks at the hands of DA Dow and a cruel, colonial, racist state that wants revenge on them for threatening the status quo.</p>\n<p><strong>We <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">refuse</span> to accept <em>any</em> of it</strong>.</p>\n<p>Abolitionist Action Central Coast / SLO, Students for Quality Education - Cal Poly, Cal Poly Black Student Union, The Central Coast Organization on Racial Injustice and all our supporters <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">call upon DA Dan Dow, Mayor Heidi Harmon of SLO, City Manager Derek Johnson &#x26; the SLO City Council, and the SLO County Board of Supervisors to fulfill our concrete, specific demands (laid out here).</span></strong> <strong>We will NO LONGER accept justice denied.</strong> We will fight to protect each other and to bring a better world into existence until the fight is done. The people <em>will</em> have these <strong>charges dropped</strong>, the people <em>will</em> know a Central Coast <strong>divested from the carceral system</strong> that does so much harm to our communities, and the people <em>will</em> achieve the dream of a Central Coast that <strong>invests in our communities’ well-being</strong> rather than in cops, cages, and state control.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember also that the other context of this current moment</strong> is the increasing onslaughtof <strong>neoliberalism &#x26; privatization,</strong> and the <strong>defunding of programs supporting</strong> affordable housing, education, mental healthcare, &#x26; other public spending on <strong>the common good</strong> – all while policing &#x26; incarceration budgets go up and up and up and up and up. Furthermore, all this divestment from meaningful public spending on our communities is coming to its peak <strong>in the midst of a historic pandemic</strong>, in which we have seen the cruel, cruel nature of our system laid bare, and in which <strong>Black / brown / Native folks</strong>, <strong>low-income folks</strong>, and other marginalized people are <strong>suffering disproportionately</strong>. We need <em>more</em> support now, not less. But it has not come.</p>\n<p>Rent has not been cancelled. People are having to work &#x26; be exposed to the virus to survive. The labor of folks who did not merit enough concern to be granted a living wage before, such as farmworkers, grocery workers, sanitation workers, and gig workers, is now deemed “essential” for our society to function, although these people are <em>still</em> without a living wage.</p>\n<p><strong>All this to increase the profits of a tiny, tiny sector of our society.</strong> All this to make more riches for the ones who have always benefited the most from this colonial white supremacist, cisheteropatriarchal, ableist, capitalist system, making our lives unlivable and building their obscene wealth off our backs. <strong>FUCK THAT. We will not have it.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">If Black Lives Matter to you, they must matter in the struggles of the everyday as well as in the big moments.</span></strong> If you wish to have <em>justice</em> in our community, if you would have us begin to heal the wounds of structural &#x26; systemic oppression, if you believe marginalized people should be able to live our lives freely &#x26; fully, then you must care about structural &#x26; systemic oppression continuing every day right here on the Central Coast. <strong>We will be satisfied with a SLO City, SLO County, and Central Coast where Black people, Indigenous people, all people of color, and all marginalized people are able to thrive. We will accept <em>nothing</em> less.</strong></p>\n<p>We demand DA Dow drop the charges. We demand a universal housing guarantee. We demand rent, mortgage, &#x26; utility relief for all retroactive to April. We demand a 33% reduction in police / sheriff’s budget &#x26; headcount, and a rejection of all proposed increases to their budgets, size, and facilities. We demand decriminalization &#x26; freeing people from jails for public health.</p>\n<p><strong>If Black lives matter to you, then you will help fight for concrete structural &#x26; systemic change here with us this year. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Take the actions laid out in this toolkit in the following pages. Tell your friends about our efforts and the need for our governments to grant <em>all</em> our demands.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>And be ready to help us fight</strong> for these changes we so desperately need. The Central Coast must no longer value cops, cages, &#x26; the carceral state over people’s lives. The Central Coast must <em>no longer</em> refuse to provide its people with the pandemic support we need.</p>\n<p><strong>Show up for the people in this community who need you the most</strong>. We can win this together. But to win this we must be able to project the will of the people into the streets, in defiance of those who will try to stop us.</p>\n<p><strong>State repression is no joke. But we can prevail together. We can win. We <em>will</em> win.</strong></p>\n<p>Now we must make it happen.

The majority of routine patrol officers’ daily tasks do not require weapons (they spend most of their time writing traffic citations). These two facts lead to one conclusion: for the safety of the community, SLO must work to disarm its officers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Services, Not Sweeps</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>End houseless sweeps and provide bathrooms, showers, hand washing stations, laundry vouchers, dumpsters, vermin abatement, &#x26; cleaning supplies instead.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Involuntary houselessness exists as a result of deeply rooted systems like racial capitalism that cause poverty. Sweeps of houseless encampments do nothing for the community; instead they waste resources on the harassment of our community members and do nothing to solve the problem. For the safety and well-being of all its people, SLO must invest its resources into easing the burdens of people experiencing houselessness, not adding to them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Decriminalize Survival</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Decriminalize sex &#x26; drug work and public order &#x26; all houselessness-related offenses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Policing, arresting, and fining community members for trying to survive does not create peace. These ordinances do nothing to address the systems that result in that person struggling to survive; on the contrary, they perpetuate inequality by requiring police to harass, fine, and issue citations to already-struggling community members.

End the policy of providing paid leave for officers &#x26; sheriff’s deputies under investigation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Police officers do not protect public safety and yet they are given an immense amount of power, influence, and immunity. Officers who abuse this power must be terminated immediately for the safety of the people, and the force must be reduced. Furthermore, those with a badge who impede justice do not deserve to enjoy paid vacations while under investigation, especially while those who were harmed continue to struggle to make ends meet.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Care, Not Cops</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>End police contracts with and police presence in nonprofits &#x26; social services, care services, shelters, hospitals, schools, colleges, and government agencies providing care.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Again, police don’t provide for public safety or well-being.
