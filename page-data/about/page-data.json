We situate our efforts within the context of our governments’ lack of support for the people during this historic pandemic: <strong>rent has not been cancelled,</strong> and <strong>people are having to work &#x26; be exposed to the virus to survive,</strong> and <strong>we <em>demand</em> better.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We draw our inspiration from the Black radical tradition and feminist-of-color organizing &#x26; praxis (theory + practice).</strong> We run political education &#x26; mutual aid projects in the community, and <strong>we engage in direct action to win our concrete, abolitionist, liberatory demands</strong> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">from SLO City Council, SLO County Board of Supervisors, and DA Dan Dow</span>.</p>\n<p><strong><em>We will not stop until the people in power have granted the people our demands</em></strong>. The demands, along with ways to take action with us to make them happen, can be found on our website.
